## FAQ

### Why not use X?

This project was started due to the frustrations I've had with other self hosted photo management software. Many were 80% of the way there for me, but lacked one or two critical features for me to use. Some projects were also a nightmare to get running, and couldn't handle remote storage.

### The name is terrible

I agree, I'm open to suggestions

### Your Composition API code is a bit weird

I'm also using this project as an excuse to get more comfortable with Vue's composition api. I'm not the best at it yet, so any feedback on how to better use it is appreciated.
